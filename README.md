# Data Science Notes

Welcome to the **Data Science Notes** repository! 🎓 This repository contains my personal notes and materials from my university coursework in Data Science. It is a work-in-progress and will also include additional uploads as I continue to expand and refine the content.

## 📚 About the Repository

- **Purpose**: Serve as a consolidated resource for my studies and a potential reference for others.
- **Content**: Organized notes covering topics such as:
  - Data Mining
  - Machine Learning
  - Data Visualization
  - Other related subjects

## 🚀 Features

- **Well-Organized Notes**: Content structured by topics, modules, or courses for ease of navigation.
- **Personalized Explanations**: Includes insights, tips, and interpretations tailored to my understanding.
- **Examples and Exercises**: Practical examples and problem-solving exercises (to be added over time).

## 🗂️ Structure

Mainly, this structure is organized by **Data Science** priority topics. It starts with **Essential** knowledge about this field, covering core areas that you must understand. Then, you will find **Recommended** topics, which provide information to expand the knowledge previously acquired. Each topic *(represented as a subject-folder within each priority area)* contains:

- **Notes**: Markdown files with detailed explanations, definitions, and formulas.
- **Examples**: Interactive Jupyter notebooks demonstrating applications and coding exercises.
- **References**: Links and resources for further reading.

Finally, the repository structure looks like this:


```bash
.
├── Essential
│   ├── 1_Data_Mining
│   ├── 2_Machine_Learning
│   ├── 3_Bayesian
│   └── 4_Deep_Learning
├── Recommended
│   ├── Big_Data
│   ├── Data_Base
│   ├── Numerical_Methods
│   └── Optimization
├── LICENSE
└── README.md
```

> [!NOTE]
> The folders of each topic will be uploaded progressively, this is the outline of what I have in mind... although changes may arise.

## ✨ How to Use
